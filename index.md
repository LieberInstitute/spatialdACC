# Spatio-molecular gene expression reflects dorsal anterior cingulate cortex structure and function in the human brain
## Overview

Welcome to the `spatial_dACC` project! In this study, we generated
spatially-resolved transcriptomics (SRT) and single-nucleus
RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) data from adjacent tissue sections of the
dorsal anterior cingulate cortex across ten adult neurotypical donors. SRT
data was generated using [10x Genomics
**Visium**](https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/spatial-gene-expression)
(n=17 capture areas). snRNA-seq data was generated using [10x Genomics
**Chromium**](https://www.10xgenomics.com/products/single-cell-gene-expression)
(n=10 total snRNA-seq libraries).

Thank you for your interest in our work!

## Study design

![Experimental Overview](./img/dACC_overview.png)

Experimental design to generate paired single-nucleus RNA-sequencing
(snRNA-seq) and spatially-resolved transcriptomics (SRT) data in the
human dorsal anterior cingulate cortex. (A) dACC (blue) and dlPFC (pink) outlined at midsagittal (dACC) and lateral (dlPFC) levels as well as in a coronal hemislabs (top). dACC tissue (blue) used here was sourced from the same n=10 neurotypical control donors previously similarly profiled for dlPFC (pink) to facilitate within-donor comparisons of dACC agranular cortex vs. dlPFC granular cortex (bottom).

(B) Fresh-frozen coronal brain slab taken at the level of the anterior striatum overlaid with the outline of major landmarks from the Atlas of the Human Brain (Mai et al. 2015). Three Brodmann areas (BA) 33, 24, and 32 corresponding to the dACC are highlighted in yellow (top left). H&E staining of tissue cryosections confirmed inclusion of dACC on the tissue block (top right). Following anatomical validation, cryosections were collected for 10X Visium and Chromium assays from the same brain block for each donor (bottom). (This figure was created with
